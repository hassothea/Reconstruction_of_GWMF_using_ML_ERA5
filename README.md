# Reconstruction_of_GWMF_using_ML_ERA5
This repository contains the codes and information for the manuscript entitled "Reconstructing gravity wave momentum fluxes using ML and input from ERA5".

The ``python`` file in this repository allows you to train the model of the present paper. Moreover, the hyperparameters and some results (correlations and feature importances) of the models are provided in the folder ``Pretrained_parameters_results`` of this repository. To use the codes, you may need to provide the ``path_to_datasets`` in the codes.
